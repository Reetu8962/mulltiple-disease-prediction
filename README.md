🧠 Multiple Disease Prediction System – Full Theory
📌 1. Introduction
A Multiple Disease Prediction System is a machine learning-based application that can predict various diseases based on user input like symptoms or medical test values. Instead of creating separate systems for each disease, this unified platform allows users to check for multiple diseases from a single place.

🎯 2. Objective
The main goal is to help users or doctors identify possible diseases early using:

Patient's clinical data (like sugar level, blood pressure)

Or symptom inputs (like fever, cough, fatigue)

🔍 3. Diseases Covered
The system usually includes:

Diabetes

Heart Disease

Chronic Kidney Disease

Parkinson’s Disease

Liver Disease

Hepatitis

Breast Cancer

Lung Cancer

Jaundice

General Disease Predictor (based on symptoms)

Each disease is predicted using a separate ML model, trained on relevant datasets.

🛠️ 4. Technologies Used
Component	Technology
Frontend	Streamlit
Backend	Python, NumPy, Pandas
Machine Learning	scikit-learn, XGBoost
Model Saving	Pickle, Joblib
Visualization	Matplotlib, Plotly
Others	PIL, Base64, Seaborn

📚 5. Workflow / System Architecture
🔁 Step-by-step Flow:
User selects a disease (from sidebar or menu)

User inputs values (symptoms or test results)

Preprocessing of input data

ML model is loaded

Prediction is made using .predict()

Result is displayed (e.g., "You have Diabetes" or "Healthy")

🧠 6. Machine Learning Models
Each model includes:
Dataset: CSV file with patient data and target (e.g., "diabetic" or "not diabetic")

Training: Model is trained using classification algorithms:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Decision Tree

XGBoost

Model Saving: After training, model is saved using pickle or joblib
